# DeveloperTriage

TriageBot is a bot designed to help reduce the time wasted in manually looking up issues and assigning them to the appropriate developers. While this might be trivial in small projects, the added benefit is valuable in big company wide projects. The bot, upon request, will provide developers with a list of issues that suit their skill set and expertise based on issues they've previously worked on. It also provides a better collaborative environment by suggesting different developers that might help with an issue if the current developer is having difficulties finishing the job on his own. The bot would suggest developers who have previously worked on similar closed issues.
