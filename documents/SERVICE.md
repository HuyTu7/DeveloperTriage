##Service Milestone

In the previous milestone, we described 3 use cases and implemented interaction with the bot by using mock data and services. In this milestone, we will be implementing the internal logic required to actually perform the services/tasks via our Developer Triage Bot.

### Use Case 1: 
- We return the list that is sorted that is similar to the issues that the users have worked on the past based on our matching issues method.
- Better conversation flow.

### Use Case 2: 
- We updated so that if there is no deadline for a specific user then it would suggest to assign issues to that user.
- Better conversation flow.

### Use Case 3:
- We return the list of users that have worked on similar issues to the input issue from the developer that requested for help.
